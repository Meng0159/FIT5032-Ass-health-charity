  "content": "This study investigates the relationship between social media use and depressive symptoms in adolescents aged 13-18. Using a mixed-methods approach, we collected data from 5,000 participants across diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Our findings indicate a significant correlation between excessive social media use and increased depressive symptoms, particularly in females. We also identified protective factors, such as strong offline social connections and mindful social media practices. The paper concludes with recommendations for parents, educators, and policymakers to promote healthier digital habits and support adolescent mental wellbeing in the digital age."
